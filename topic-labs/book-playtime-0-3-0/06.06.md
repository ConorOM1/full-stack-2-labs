# Engage the JSON Stores

Even though we have included the JSON Store modules, the application is still wired to user the Men Stores. This is easily changed:

## db.js

~~~javascript
// import { userMemStore } from "./mem/user-mem-store.js";
// import { playlistMemStore } from "./mem/playlist-mem-store.js";
// import { trackMemStore } from "./mem/track-mem-store.js";

import { userJsonStore } from "./json/user-json-store.js";
import { playlistJsonStore } from "./json/playlist-json-store.js";
import { trackJsonStore } from "./json/track-json-store.js";

export const db = {
  userStore: null,
  playlistStore: null,
  trackStore: null,

  init() {
    this.userStore = userJsonStore;
    this.playlistStore = playlistJsonStore;
    this.trackStore = trackJsonStore;
  },
};
~~~

This is the only change we need to make, as all of the controllers access the data store via the `db` object, which we have remapped to there JSON Stores above 

As you add users, playlists and tracks keep an eye on the JSON files to verify that the data is being store as expected.
